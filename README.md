# Neovim configuration

Most of it is based on [ThePrimeagen/init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

# Features
- Packer to install plugins.
- Random color themes I was giving a chance and then was too lazy to remove later, even though I know I won't be switching themes ever.
- Treesitter. I don't remember what is it for.
- Harpoon. At first underrated it, then I learned the hard way.
- Undotree. Ctrl-z.
- Vim Fugitive.
- LSP. Finally got it to work after three attempts.
- Autopairs. Insert `)]}'"/`` automagically.
- Lualine. Where am I.
- Gitsigns. What did I do.
- Barbecue. File paths at the top.
